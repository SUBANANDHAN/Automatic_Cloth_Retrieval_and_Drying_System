# Automatic_Cloth_Retrieval_and_Drying_System

In today's world, Weather can change from sunny to rainy days, and it can be challenging for a working couple to find time to have a laundry day where the fabric is dried throughout the entire day. This project uses an Arduino UNO microcontroller to install all of the programs that will provide instructions for operating this system correctly. When it's sunny outside, this project will automatically retrieve out the clothing, and when it's raining, it will automatically retrieve in the clothing. For this component to retrieve out and retrieve in all the clothing, two servo motors must be used to convert electrical power into mechanical power. The temperature sensors that will be used in this project are more accurate at measuring both the temperature and the day's weather, whether it be sunny or rainy.

This project aims to estimate the light intensity, temperature, and rain and accordingly retrieve the clothes using the stepper motors. The project uses the Arduino Uno to operate the sensors. In this way, one can easily take care of their clothes without intervening manually.
